[SeedSettings]

	- _startcobwebduster_: If 'True', Adds the Cobweb Duster to your inventory at the start of the game,
	opening access to more locations from the beginning. Has priority over 'randomizecobwebduster'

	- _startlevitation_: If 'True', Adds one Levitation to starting inventory. Location in seed is replaced with
	a Psicard.

	- _startbutton_: If 'True', Adds Sasha's Button to starting inventory, unlocking Campgrounds. Location in seed is replaced with
	a Psicard.

	- _randomizecobwebduster_: If 'True', Removes Cobweb Duster from the shop and adds it to the item pool,
	replacing a Psicard. Overridden by 'startcobwebduster'.

	- _everylocationpossible_: Want to guarantee every location can be reached for a 100% completion run? 
	Turn this on to make sure the generator knows no location can be left behind! Does not change player requirements for completing the game.

	- _instantdeath_: WARNING!!! USE AT OWN RISK!!! If 'True', Raz will die instantly upon taking any amount of damage. 
	Dream Fluffs and defensive measures are your best friend. Just don't make any mistakes.

[VictoryConditions]

	- _beatoleander_: The original win condition, if 'True' this requires getting to the top of the Asylum
 	and fighting the Coach Oleander Brain Tank before finishing the game.

	- _rank101_: Race to max rank! If 'True', reaching Rank101 is mandatory to complete the game.
	Time to crack some vaults, sort some baggage, and snag some figments!.

	- _brainhunt_: Save the children! If 'True', player must find and break all 19 Brain Jars and 
	return them all to Ford's Sanctuary for re-braining to beat the game. No child left behind.

	- _scavengerhunt_: Ford DEMANDS you finish his Scavenger Hunt before you save the world. If 'True', 
	all 16 scavenger hunt items must be gathered and redeemed with Ford in the GPC before finishing the game.

	- _beatalllevels_: If 'True', you MUST complete every mental level in the game to access the final boss.
	Does not include finishing the Asylum and Oleander Brain Tank.

[QualityOfLife]

	- _fasterLO_: Feeling sluggish in Lungfishopolis? If 'True', all of Raz's animations in Lungfishopolis are faster than normal, 
	AND you can use Levitation to ride the levitation ball around! No floating or flying though.

	- _easymillarace_: If losing to Bobby and having to restart Milla's race annoys you, set this to 'True'.
	This setting removes Bobby from the race entirely, as well as increasing the game speed to 1.5x.

	- _earlyelevator_: If 'True', the elevator at the Asylum entrance leading to Doctor Lobato's lab will be open 
	if your inventory contains all three disguise pieces. This lets you skip the Upper Asylum floors if you've
	already got all required powers and the cake.

	- _mentalmagnet_: If 'True', start with the Mental Magnet badge in your inventory for easy health and ammo pickups.

[AdditionalFiles]

	- _spoilerlog_: This setting is recommended to be left as 'True', generates SpoilerLog.txt, 
	a list of all randomized items and their locations. Only turn this off to guarantee no cheating to find missing items.

	- _createhints_: If 'True', generates Hints.txt, which lists a number of item locations meant to be viewed before
	you start playing. The total number of hints and detail level of the hints is determined by the settings below.
