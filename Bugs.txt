General Bugs:

--KNOWN ASTRALATHE BUG, WW has crashes if you let cutscenes play in entirety,
skip cutscene to avoid!!!

--move MM item (vanilla is hatbox behind cobweb)
so it can't be grabbed through walls, doesn't clip through floor

--Vaults in MM tend to float away? Gravity not applied correctly.


THINGS TO DO:
--Needs logic!!! How do we implement this?

--Sasha's Shooting Gallery Needs implemented.

--Black Velvetopia potential shop rando? Card Reward rando? Needs something...

--Loading saves often crashes the game

--CA Lodge Shop Rando?
