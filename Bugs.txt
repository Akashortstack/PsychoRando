General Bugs:

--Gloria's Theater returning after Boss Fight, stage changes is broken

--Collecting Steamertrunk in BB causes player to teleport to vanilla steamertrunk location

--Vanilla game bug: Sasha's Shooting Gallery can softlock during tutorial if player doesn't collect Health Drop in time.

--Gloria's Trophy will spawn in it's vanilla location if placed within the Asylum Entrance (ASGR)

--Milka's Brain Defaults to Vanilla location in Crow Basket if spawned in Asylum Lower Levels

--KNOWN ASTRALATHE BUG, WW has crashes if you let cutscenes play in entirety,
skip cutscenes to avoid!!!

--PsiPowers hard to see because of lighting issues. How to fix?

--Hornet Nest sometimes doesn't spawn, maybe because fertility idol already collected?

--Below issues can happen randomly, keep trying different fixes

    --Geyser item sometimes doesn't load

    --Squirrel Disappears sometimes

--move MM item (hatbox behind cobweb) to the right so it can't be grabbed through walls, doesn't clip through floor

--Gravity sometimes not applied correctly in MM
    --item in Post Office (vanilla baggage) sometimes in floor
    --Vaults in MM sometimes float away into the void

THINGS TO DO:

--Add requirements to enter Sasha's and Milla's minds? Learner's Permits?

--Add more junk items? 

--Speed up animations in Lungfishopolis? QoL change?

--Needs better logic!!! How do we implement this?
    --Randomization method update, SeedGenerator overhaul

--Update seed generator and randomizer to support different settings, add settings page and "Generate" Button

--Black Velvetopia potential shop painting rando? Card Reward rando? Needs work...
    --Could remove shop functionality entirely, just be collectible spots. Doesn't feel good.
