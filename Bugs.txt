General Bugs:

--KNOWN ASTRALATHE BUG, WW has crashes if you let cutscenes play in entirety,
skip cutscenes to avoid!!!

--PsiPowers hard to see because of lighting issues. How to fix?

--Hornet Nest sometimes doesn't spawn, maybe because fertility idol already collected?

--Geyser item also sometimes doesn't load

--Prop Helmet, Prop Phone, and paintings from BV appear as "unknown text string" in inventory,
need to adjust text on these items.

--move MM item (hatbox behind cobweb) to the right so it can't be grabbed through walls, doesn't clip through floor

--Gravity sometimes not applied correctly in MM
    --item in Post Office (vanilla baggage) sometimes in floor
    --Vaults in MM sometimes float away into the void


THINGS TO DO:

--Needs better logic!!! How do we implement this?
    --Randomization method update, SeedGenerator overhaul

--Update seed generator script to create SpoilerLog.txt

--Black Velvetopia potential shop rando? Card Reward rando? Needs rework...

--Trying to load saves sometimes crashes the game, has improved recently but still keeping an eye on this

--CA Lodge Shop Rando? Causes MAJOR logic problems involving cobweb duster
