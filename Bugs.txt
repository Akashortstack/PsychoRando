General Bugs:

--Vanilla game bug: Sasha's Shooting Gallery can softlock during tutorial if player doesn't collect Health Drop in time.

--Gloria's Trophy will spawn in it's vanilla location if placed within the Asylum Entrance (ASGR)

--KNOWN ASTRALATHE BUG, WW has crashes if you let cutscenes play in entirety,
skip cutscenes to avoid!!!

--PsiPowers hard to see because of lighting issues. How to fix?

--Hornet Nest sometimes doesn't spawn, maybe because fertility idol already collected?

--Below issues possibly caused by turning in scavenger hunt items to Ford?

    --Geyser item sometimes doesn't load

    --Squirrel Disappears sometimes...

--move MM item (hatbox behind cobweb) to the right so it can't be grabbed through walls, doesn't clip through floor

--Gravity sometimes not applied correctly in MM
    --item in Post Office (vanilla baggage) sometimes in floor
    --Vaults in MM sometimes float away into the void


THINGS TO DO:

--Create incentive to FINISH a level. One brain of health isn't good enough.

--Waterloo World Fireplace collectible position needs added

--Speed up animations in Lungfishopolis? QoL change?

--Needs better logic!!! How do we implement this?
    --Randomization method update, SeedGenerator overhaul

--Update seed generator script to create SpoilerLog.txt

--Update seed generator and randomizer to support different settings

--Black Velvetopia potential shop rando? Card Reward rando? Needs rework...

--Trying to load saves sometimes crashes the game, has improved recently but still keeping an eye on this

--CA Lodge Shop Rando? Causes MAJOR logic problems involving cobweb duster
