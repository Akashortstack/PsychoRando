General Bugs:

--If any Peasant Item spawns in WW, item's Peasant has no voicelines unless item is collected, works normal afterwards

--Gloria's Theater can potentially crash very late into a seed. Cause Unknown, possibly goal manager related?

--Vanilla game bug: Sasha's Shooting Gallery can softlock during tutorial if player doesn't collect Health Drop in time.

--Milka's Brain Defaults to Vanilla location in Crow Basket if spawned in Asylum Lower Levels

--Below issues can happen randomly, keep trying different fixes

    --Geyser item sometimes doesn't load

    --Squirrel Disappears sometimes

    --Hornet Nest sometimes doesn't spawn, maybe because fertility idol already collected?

--Some locations need adjusting cleanup
    --item in MM Post Office (vanilla baggage) sometimes in floor

THINGS TO DO:

--Cleanup Milkman
    --Make house items only spawn if entering the correct house
    --changes logic requirements, cobweb duster AND watering can

--Add settings page and "Generate" Button to Seed Generator

--Look into applying certain sounds across all levels using below codes
    --LoadSoundData('mm'), Loads all sounds from Milkman
    --Need to fix Subtitle issues for most collectibles

--Remove More Tutorials?
    --bDisableTutorialBoxes only works if in Debug Level Select. Why?

--Add Edgar's Playing Cards and Paintings to item pool?

--Create Item Tracker?

--Add requirements to enter minds? Brain Jars with character brains?

--Add more junk items?

--Black Velvetopia potential shop painting rando? Needs work...
    --Could remove shop functionality entirely, just be collectible spots. Doesn't feel good.
