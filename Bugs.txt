General Bugs:

--Collecting Steamertrunk in BB causes player to teleport to vanilla steamertrunk location

--Gloria's Theater can potentially crash very late into a seed. Cause Unknown, possibly goal manager related?

--Vanilla game bug: Sasha's Shooting Gallery can softlock during tutorial if player doesn't collect Health Drop in time.

--Milka's Brain Defaults to Vanilla location in Crow Basket if spawned in Asylum Lower Levels

--KNOWN ASTRALATHE BUG, WW has crashes if you let cutscenes play in entirety,
skip cutscenes to avoid!!!

--Below issues can happen randomly, keep trying different fixes

    --Geyser item sometimes doesn't load

    --Squirrel Disappears sometimes

    --Hornet Nest sometimes doesn't spawn, maybe because fertility idol already collected?

--Some locations need adjusting cleanup
    --item in MM Post Office (vanilla baggage) sometimes in floor

THINGS TO DO:

--Look into applying sounds across all levels using below code
    --LoadSoundData('mm')

--Remove Tutorials?

--Add Edgar's Playing Cards and Paintings to item pool?

--Create Item Tracker

--Add requirements to enter Sasha's and Milla's minds? Learner's Permits?

--Add more junk items? 

--Update seed generator, add settings page and "Generate" Button

--Black Velvetopia potential shop painting rando? Needs work...
    --Could remove shop functionality entirely, just be collectible spots. Doesn't feel good.

--Change Campgrounds to load Daytime instead of Nightime levels?
