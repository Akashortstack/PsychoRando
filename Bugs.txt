General Bugs:

--If any Peasant Item spawns in WW, item's matching Peasant has no voicelines unless item is collected, works normal afterwards

--Gloria's Theater can potentially crash very late into a seed. Cause Unknown, possibly goal manager related?

--Vanilla game bug: Sasha's Shooting Gallery can softlock during tutorial if player doesn't collect mandatory Health Ammo, leaves stage instead.

--Below issues can happen randomly, keep trying different fixes

    --Geyser item sometimes doesn't load

    --Squirrel Disappears sometimes

    --Hornet Nest sometimes doesn't spawn, maybe because fertility idol already collected?

--Some locations need adjusting cleanup
    --item in MM Post Office (vanilla baggage) sometimes in floor

THINGS TO DO:

--Add settings page and "Generate" Button to Seed Generator

--Give Brain Jars interestfx for more visibility?

--Milka's Brain Defaults to Vanilla location in Crow Basket if spawned in Asylum Lower Levels
    --change location to require invis? work like vanilla game? Changes logic.

--Cleanup Milkman
    --Make house items only spawn if entering the correct house
    --changes logic requirements, cobweb duster AND watering can

--Look into applying certain sounds across all levels
    --Using LoadSoundData() game loads ENTIRE LEVEL sounds, instead of just one sound, increases load times significantly

--Add requirements to enter minds? Brain Jars with character brains?
    --Disable random/certain doors?

--Add more locked locations to Campgrounds?
    --Lili's Bracelet locks Kid's Cabins
    --Oarsman's Badge locks Lake
    --What would lock the Recreation area? Crow Feather?

--Add more junk items?

--Add Edgar's Playing Cards and Paintings to item pool?

--Black Velvetopia potential shop painting rando? Needs work...
    --Could remove shop functionality entirely, just be collectible spots. Doesn't feel good.
