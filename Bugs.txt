General Bugs:

--Collecting Steamertrunk in BB causes player to teleport to vanilla steamertrunk location

--Gloria's Theater can potentially crash very late into a seed. Cause Unknown, possibly goal manager related?

--Vanilla game bug: Sasha's Shooting Gallery can softlock during tutorial if player doesn't collect Health Drop in time.

--Milka's Brain Defaults to Vanilla location in Crow Basket if spawned in Asylum Lower Levels

--Below issues can happen randomly, keep trying different fixes

    --Geyser item sometimes doesn't load

    --Squirrel Disappears sometimes

    --Hornet Nest sometimes doesn't spawn, maybe because fertility idol already collected?

--Some locations need adjusting cleanup
    --item in MM Post Office (vanilla baggage) sometimes in floor

THINGS TO DO:

--Add items to Hud Popup?
    --Baggage Tags by type

--Look into applying sounds across all levels using below codes
    --LoadSoundData('mm'), Loads all sounds from Milkman
    --LoadSoundData('BVEB') loads all baggage sounds, DONE

--Remove More Tutorials?

--Add Edgar's Playing Cards and Paintings to item pool?

--Create Item Tracker?

--Add requirements to enter minds? Brain Jars with character brains?

--Add more junk items?

--Update seed generator, add settings page and "Generate" Button

--Black Velvetopia potential shop painting rando? Needs work...
    --Could remove shop functionality entirely, just be collectible spots. Doesn't feel good.
