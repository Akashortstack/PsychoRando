General Bugs:

If any Peasant Item spawns in WW, item's matching Peasant has no voicelines unless item is collected, works normal afterwards

Vanilla game bug: Sasha's Shooting Gallery can softlock during tutorial if player doesn't collect mandatory Health Ammo, leaves stage instead.

Some locations need adjusting cleanup
    item in MM Post Office (vanilla baggage) sometimes in floor

THINGS TO DO:

Give Brain Jars interestfx for more visibility?

Cleanup Milkman
    Make house items only spawn if entering the correct house
    changes logic requirements, cobweb duster AND watering can

Look into applying certain sounds across all levels
    Using LoadSoundData() game loads ENTIRE LEVEL sounds, instead of just one sound, increases load times significantly

Add more junk items?

Add Edgar's Playing Cards and Paintings to item pool?

Black Velvetopia potential shop painting rando? Needs work...
    Could remove shop functionality entirely, just be collectible spots. Doesn't feel good.
