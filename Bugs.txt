General Bugs:

--KNOWN ASTRALATHE BUG, WW has crashes if you let cutscenes play in entirety,
skip cutscenes to avoid!!!

--Hornet Nest didn't spawn, maybe because fertility idol already collected?

--ScavSquirrel Didn't spawn, already collected golden acorn, Ford Scav hunt items turned in before.
--Geyser item didn't load, also after scav hunt turn in

--Prop Helmet, Prop Phone, and paintings from BV appear as "unknown text string" in inventory,
need to adjust text on these items.

--move MM item (hatbox behind cobweb) to the right so it can't be grabbed through walls, doesn't clip through floor

--Gravity sometimes not applied correctly in MM
    --item in Post Office (vanilla baggage) sometimes in floor
    --Vaults in MM sometimes float away into the void


THINGS TO DO:
--Needs logic!!! How do we implement this?
    --Randomization method update, SeedGenerator.lua change

--Create a lua script for creating SpoilerLog.txt

--Sasha's Shooting Gallery Needs implemented.

--Brains Collected in menu should be viewable whenever, currently only if you've found a brain in AS

--Black Velvetopia potential shop rando? Card Reward rando? Needs something...

--Trying to load saves often crashes the game, potentially an Astralathe problem?

--CA Lodge Shop Rando?
